# Cmder

Setup the preferences for Cmder.

## Usage

Note: The setup script directory structure depends on Cmder being installed by Scoop.

In the command prompt, 

``setup.cmd``

The script creates a symbolic link of the preferences to the dotfiles in this repo. A copy of the preferences is saved in the `temp` folder.
