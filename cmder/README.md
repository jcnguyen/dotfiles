# Cmder

## Setup

The setup script directory structure depends on Cmder being installed by Scoop.

1. Verify the correct paths in the script
2. Run Cmder as an admin
3. Run `setup.cmd`
4. May need to discard changes to `ConEmu.xml` to see changes

The script creates a symbolic link of the preferences to the dotfiles in this repo. A copy of the preferences is saved in the `temp` folder.

## Cheatsheet

- List all the aliases: `alias`
