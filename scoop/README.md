# Scoop

[Scoop](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop) is a command-line installer for Windows. 

## Install Scoop and Packages

Requires PowerShell 5. As always, read the script before running it. If `scoop` or a package is already installed, installer will skip it.

In PowerShell

``./Install-Scoop.ps1``
